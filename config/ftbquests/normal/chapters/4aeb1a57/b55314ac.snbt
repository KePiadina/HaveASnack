		"Crop sticks work in 2 modes: spread (vertical sticks), and mutation (crossed)",
		"",
		"Spread sticks can house a plant that will, well, spread to other free crop sticks when growing",
		"",
		"Mutation sticks can interact with the surrounding (spread) crop sticks, and will have a chance to get a mutated crop based off of its parents (surrounding plants). When similar plants combine, the result will usually be a plant with higher stats. When different plants combine, they may create a new type of plant.",
		"",
		"Plants do not need to grow together to be crossbred, they just need to be mature. So, if you wanted to pair crops with different fertile seasons, you would have to keep the early crop to mature and let the later crop grow and cross.",
